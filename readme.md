AIRA – AI Infrastructure Resilience Assistant

AIRA is a no-code, agentic AI-powered assistant that helps citizens report city infrastructure issues — such as potholes, water leaks, and streetlight failures — and automates routing, assignment, and simulated status updates using IBM watsonx Orchestrate.

Built for the Call for Code 2025 Global Hackathon
Covers Track 2: Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure, powered by Track 1: Agent Mode Activated

Key Features

Chatbot Interface: Citizens report issues in natural language via a conversational flow

Classification Agent: Identifies issue type (Road, Water, Electrical)

Orchestration Agent: Assigns department, simulates scheduling, generates dynamic ticket IDs

Status Agent: Simulates live status updates with feedback loop

Built fully using IBM watsonx Orchestrate Assistant Builder — no external code or APIs
